	\vspace{8pt}The project consisted of autonomously launching and landing a quadcopter on an unmanned surface vehicle. An IRIS quadcopter, equipped with a Pixhawk controller, was outfitted with a Raspberry Pi backseat driver for autonomous control. Python, MAVlink and OpenCV were utilized to interface with the vehicle and provide autonomous control and image processing. Through image processing, an IR light source was identified and used to guide the quadcopter to the landing platform.
